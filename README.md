# Hackathon

This repository serves as an archive for all ODC hackathon materials, including entries, instructions, and other related materials.

## Resources

There will be a hackathon channel on our discord for each hackathon hosted by or in collaboration with the ODC. The channel will be named after the hackathon (e.g. DataBuilder-Hackathon-2023)
